2) "Recommeded booth options should be available based on settings. Example: I can set a booth as a 10 case booth, and it adds it to the order 10 cases added would be based on what I had in settins as a 10 case booth. Mark all of these as ordered"
    - What do you mean "mark all of these as ordered"? Only for booth

3) "Separate out booth cookies as those can be returned to council. Pull all orders marked as ordered. Fill  them individually. Group all orders from one person together. Would be nice if system told me which orders to fill automatically. Notify parents that orders are ready for pick up"
    - Is this only for booth cookies, or is this general case for all orders? For now mark it as booth or normal order

4) Confirm order: Leader fill the order, then mark as ready to pickup -> Parent confirm order and pickup -> Parent's inventory only get update when they mark that they picked up the order

5) Parent update with sale (manually, only cash for now): Parent notify leader with cookies sales -> leader input the cash they receive into the system -> Update the order and trooper inventory -> Parent get notify 
    - Input in a field using creditcard transaction to update the order
    - 2 field: cash or credit

6) Order creation: 
    - In stock: reduce leader inventory (troop inventory) -> notify leader to fill these order. This need some clarification
    - Not in stock: cancel the order -> set the missing cookie in the pile -> notify leader to order    
        - Mark as unfilled instead, when the cookie is in inventory, update to filled

7) Parent return cookies: 
    - All cookie or just booth cookie ?
    - Update inventory and balance when turn in -> the same for leader inventory (troop inventory) -> receive notification
